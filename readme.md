# How to run?

Because I'm using just vanilla js and simple webpack
just open the file in the folder:
`/dist/index.html`
in your browser

If you want to re-build run 
- `npm install`
- `npm start build`

To test

- `npm install`
- `npm test`



# Welcome

Thank you for taking your time and agreeing to take this challenge as part of our recruitment process. We understand that sometimes it can be hard to find enough time to dedicate yourself properly to this type of activity, so if for any reason you have problems related to it let us know and communicate properly what you've done and what you were still planning to do if you had more time. 

The challenge is to build _YOUR OWN IMPLEMENTATION_ of the (Hacker News website)[https://news.ycombinator.com/]. For doing so, you are encouraged to consume data from the open HN api - https://github.com/HackerNews/API, but this is not a requirement. 

This compressed folder has a git repository initialized. You are supposed to version your files and describe your changes using git, so there should be a `.git` folder accompanying your solution. 

The objective of this challenge is to assess your ability with javascript itself, so we expecte you to use _vanilla javascript_ to build the solution. You are free to use any tools you want to create tests for your application, if you feel like doing it. 

The application code will be reviewed and the application itself will be tested on a high-end mobile device.

You don't have to worry with the back-end implementation. 

When testing we'll make sure we serve the files on this repository properly. 

Imagine that you are already working at Werkspot, we want to build an improved version of HN and you were assigned the task to start it's front-end implementation.

Please don't spend more than 4 hours on this project. If you feel it would take more than that, prioritize your strenghts and select what to build in the limited timeframe that we provide.

Feel free to ask us any questions and have fun!


# Solution
Things I need to use:
- stylesheets
- virtual table - too complicated in 4 hours to build from scratch
- pagination
- collapse for comments
- nice to have- typescript
- Testing

# Notes

Super important!
 
 I was asked to do the assignment during the weekend, i didn't get any answers to my email.
 
 I was sure I am not allowed to use any js libraries, so that's why I couldn't use bootstrap css or js libraries.
 
 


in the original website there is site section, where you can see all comments from the same site.
for example: https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=github.com


I didn't do that part because I wanted to scope my work
Also I won't be doing polls api because I could not find examples in their original website

I'm using Slots, which isn't supported in old browsers ( available since Chrome 53, Opera 40, Safari 10, Firefox 59, and Edge 79.)
